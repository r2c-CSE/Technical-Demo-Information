# Technical Demo Information

## Interview Format and Objectives

Congratulations on advancing to this stage of our interview process. This interview will be a 60 minute video call that requires you to prepare for a live technical demonstration.

The format is an interactive conversation where you will present your personal Semgrep deployment while discussing details of your configuration and related technology and processes.

Our objective during this interview is to understand your technical expertise and familiarity with:
- Onboarding code repositories into Semgrep and CI
- Semgrep scan configuration and developer workflow
- Application vulnerabilities and the triage process
- Basic Semgrep rule composition and testing

## Preparation

To prepare for this interview, you will need to:
- Clone or fork a github repository and integrate it with the Semgrep Cloud Platform for scanning in CI (expected 30 minutes prep)
- Prepare to discuss the setup process and how this relates to a Developer (no expected prep outside of the other activities)
- Prepare to triage findings and evaluate them as potential vulnerabilities (expected 30 minutes prep)
- Understand the basics of Semgrep rules and prepare to customize a live example to detect security issues in code (expected 30 minutes prep)
